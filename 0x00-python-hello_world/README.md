# ALX Python Hello World

This repository contains various Python scripts demonstrating different concepts and code snippets for learning Python programming language.

## List of Scripts

1. `0-run`: A shell script that runs a Python file stored in the environment variable PYFILE.

2. `1-run_inline`: A shell script that runs Python code stored in the environment variable PYCODE.

3. `print.py`: A simple Python script that prints a float number with only 2 decimal places.

4. `print_number.py`: A Python script that prints a string 3 times followed by a newline and then prints its first 9 characters.

5. `print_float.py`: A Python script that prints a float number with only 2 decimal places and multiplies and prints a string with a given number of times.

6. `concat.py`: A Python script that concatenates two strings `str1` and `str2` and prints the result.

7. ``edges.py: A Python script that demonstrates string slicing to extract the first 3 letters, last 2 letters, and the middle word from a given string.

8. ``concat_edges.py: A Python script that prints a specific substring from a long string using the `split` method.

9. `easter_egg.py`: An Easter egg Python script with a hidden message.

10. 10-check_cycle.c, lists.h
## How to Use

To run any of the Python scripts, execute the script using the Python interpreter. For example:

python3 0-ru


Replace the `0-run` with the name of the script you want to run.
