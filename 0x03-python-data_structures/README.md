# 0x03-python-data_structures

This repository contains C and Python code examples for tasks related to data structures. The code examples and functions were developed to address various challenges and requirements.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the process of understanding and utilizing the code examples provided.

### Prerequisites

To run the C code examples, you need a C compiler installed on your system. You can use GCC or any other suitable compiler.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/0x03-python-data_structures.git


2. Navigate to the repository directory:

cd 0x03-python-data_structures


3. Compile the C code examples:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic linked_lists.c 13-is_palindrome.c -o palindrome

markdown


4. Run the compiled executable:

./palindrome

arduino


For the Python scripts, you can run them using the Python interpreter:

python 0-print_list_integer.py

less


## Code Examples

1. `0-print_list_integer.py`: A Python script that prints all integers of a list.

2. `1-element_at.py`: A Python script that retrieves an element from a list.

3. `2-replace_in_list.py`: A Python script that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.

4. `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`: A Python script that prints all integers of a list in reverse order.

5. `4-new_in_list.py`: A Python script that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

6. `5-no_c.py`: A Python script that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.

7. `6-print_matrix_integer.py`: A Python script that prints a matrix of integers.

8. `7-add_tuple.py`: A Python script that adds two tuples.

9. `8-multiple_returns.py`: A Python script that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

10. `9-max_integer.py`: A Python script that finds the biggest integer of a list.

11. `10-divisible_by_2.py`: A Python script that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

12. `11-delete_at.py`: A Python script that deletes an item at a specific position in a list.

13. `13-is_palindrome.c`: A C program that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
