Description

This repository includes several Python code snippets that cover different aspects of importing modules and using Python's standard library. The snippets demonstrate concepts such as module imports, command-line argument handling, bytecode disassembly, and more.
Code Snippets

The repository includes the following code snippets:

    0-dd.py 
    1-lower_alphabet.py: This snippet prints the lowercase alphabet using the string module without using string literals.
    2-print.py: This snippet prints the phrase "#pythoniscool" using Python's built-in print function.
    3-infinite_add.py: This snippet calculates the sum of command-line arguments and prints the result.
    4-hidden_discovery.py: This snippet disassembles a compiled Python module and prints its defined names.
    5-variable_load.py: This snippet imports a variable from a module and prints its value.
    6-compare.py: This snippet compares integers passed as command-line arguments and prints the result.
    100-my_calculator.py: This snippet implements a simple calculator based on command-line arguments and module imports.
    101-easy_print.py: This snippet prints "#pythoniscool" using the builtins module and the print function.
    102-magic_calculation.py: This snippet defines a function that emulates a given Python bytecode.

Usage

Each code snippet can be executed independently by running its associated .py file using the Python interpreter. Simply navigate to the repository directory and run the desired snippet using the following command:

bash

./snippet_filename.py

Replace snippet_filename.py with the name of the specific snippet you want to run.
